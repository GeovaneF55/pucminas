abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to introduce novel linear synchronous motor (LSM) driven assembly automation and material handling system designs with examples. Design/methodology/approach - Discusses novel LSM technology principles with some practical system design and configuration examples for automated assembly and material handling. The high energy density and rugged design offers high duty cycle, high power, rapid acceleration, improved speed, high positioning repeatability, and increased performance for demanding installations. Findings - LSMs can increase throughput, reliability and payload information feedback. They can also decrease maintenance requirements, and the total cost of installation. MagneMotion's patented QuickStick system propels and controls each vehicle independently by interacting with a permanent magnet array mounted to each vehicle. As a consequence, the vehicles do not require communication or power cables, allowing a broad range of flexible, reconfigurable configurations and move profiles. Practical implications - LSMs can increase throughput, reliability and payload information feedback. They can also decrease maintenance requirements, and the total cost of installation. Originality/value - Discusses novel LSM technology principles with some practical system design and configuration examples for automated assembly and material handling.},
