abstract = {This study presents a combined linear programming package and a user-oriented program for its data input employed in product-mix determination. An optimal product-mix is to be determined for a rapidly changing manufacturing environment. The study consists of developing an interactive computer program for the solution of a product-mix problem. The user-oriented program has been developed so that a person familiar with the plant can determine the 'best' mix which should be produced. This study provides a quantitative tool to aid in the decision-making process when time is limited and the production process dynamic.},
