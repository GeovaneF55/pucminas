	   Purpose:

	   MAIN is the main program for COMPUTE_PI.

	   Discussion:

	   COMPUTE_PI estimates the value of PI.

	   This program uses Open MP parallelization directives.  

	   It should run properly whether parallelization is used or not.

	   However, the parallel version computes the sum in a different
	   order than the serial version; some of the quantities added are
	   quite small, and so this will affect the accuracy of the results.

	   The single precision code is noticeably less accurate than the
	   double code.  Again, the amount of difference depends
	   on whether the computation is done in parallel or not.

	/******************************************************************************/
	/*
	   Purpose:

	   R8_PI_EST_OMP estimates the value of PI, using Open MP.

	   Discussion:

	   The calculation is based on the formula for the indefinite integral:

	   Integral 1 / ( 1 + X**2 ) dx = Arctan ( X ) 

	   Hence, the definite integral

	   Integral ( 0 <= X <= 1 ) 1 / ( 1 + X**2 ) dx 
	   = Arctan ( 1 ) - Arctan ( 0 )
	   = PI / 4.

	   A standard way to approximate an integral uses the midpoint rule.
	   If we create N equally spaced intervals of width 1/N, then the
	   midpoint of the I-th interval is 

	   X(I) = (2*I-1)/(2*N).  

	   The approximation for the integral is then:

	   Sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) (1/N) * 1 / ( 1 + X(I)**2 )

	   In order to compute PI, we multiply this by 4; we also can pull out
	   the factor of 1/N, so that the formula you see in the program looks like:

	   ( 4 / N ) * Sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) 1 / ( 1 + X(I)**2 )

	   Until roundoff becomes an issue, greater accuracy can be achieved by 
	   increasing the value of N.
